To enable us to do this, we need to digitize what we do. Moving so many pallets to so many customers generates a lot of data – over 2 billion rows and counting. We need to utilize modern methods to capture and analyse data, ensuring that we can track where our pallets are, what they’re being used for and ensuring they return to the pool to be reused in the future. We need to ensure what we build not only works for the now, but for the future as well.
 
 
Brambles understands the importance of digital and data and is growing heavily. Think of us as a start-up, based inside an established company. We have the benefits of a start-up, around autonomy to work and a wealth of exciting projects to deliver. Essentially this a Greenfield site so you get to help decide what the future platform looks like.

Zilch, the world’s first Commerce Card, is a UK-headquartered payments technology company, known for creating the
 
Googlisation of Payments
. Our mission is to create the best and most empowering way to pay, for anything, anywhere our customers want to spend. Using Zilch’s virtual Mastercard that sits in a customer’s digital wallet, Zilch combines the best of debit, credit and savings. Meaning our customers can either earn rewards on debit payments in the form of instant cashback (‘Pay in 1’) or spread interest-free repayments over six weeks (‘Pay in 4’), bringing them financial choice and maturing their credit profiles.
 
This is uniquely made possible by the proprietary Ad-Subsidised Payment Network (ASPN) that Zilch has built, which in cookieless world enables merchants around the world to connect directly with the millions of Zilch customers they otherwise couldn’t reach and offer them savings, deals and discounts.
 
 
By vertically integrating with consumers, rather than with merchants, Zilch allows customers to pay using either reward-earning debit or interest-free credit, both online and in-store, anywhere Mastercard is accepted. To ensure we are helping our customers to manage their cash flow responsibly when they make credit payments, we set dynamic borrowing limits using best-in-market data from leading credit reference agencies, open banking technology and behavioural data analysis. Together these generate a real-time, comprehensive, 360-degree view of a customer’s affordability profile, allowing us to set personalised borrowing limits accordingly. To further bolster our customer safeguards, we are fully regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, having obtained a consumer credit license prior to our launch.
 
 
Since launching as an FCA regulated business in the UK in September 2020 and in the US in May 2022, Zilch has amassed over 3 million customers in 24 months and turned gross profitable – years faster than other well-known fintechs. In that time, we have provided our customers with over £80 million in aggregate rewards and savings on fees and interest. Zilch is Europe’s fastest-ever company to go from Series A to double-unicorn status, in just 14 months, after raising capital at a $2bn valuation in November 2021 and maintaining that valuation in a subsequent equity funding round in Summer 2022.

Who We Are
 
GWI was founded with the knowledge that understanding your audience is really important for business. When you know who you’re speaking to and why, you can create content and campaigns that stand out to the people that matter.
Through our global online survey, we gather data on the behaviour and perceptions of consumers across the world. This provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust.
It’s been going well, too. Since launching in 2009, we’ve become one of the UK’s fastest growing target audience companies. We’re not about to stop growing any time soon. As a business, we’re on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we’re on the lookout for talented people to join us.
 
Diversity & Inclusion
 
Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We’d get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn’t have got off the ground as a business.
Although things certainly aren’t perfect, we live in a society where differences are increasingly celebrated – so we’d expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, it’s really important to us that it stays that way.

Oxford Nanopore Technologies is headquartered at the Oxford Science Park outside Oxford, UK, with satellite offices and commercial presence in many global locations across the US, APAC and Europe.
 
Oxford Nanopore employs from multiple subject areas including nanopore science, molecular biology and applications, informatics, engineering, electronics, manufacturing and commercialisation. The management team, led by CEO Dr Gordon Sanghera, has a track record of delivering disruptive technologies to the market.
 
Oxford Nanopore’s sequencing platform is the only technology that offers real-time analysis (for rapid insights), in fully scalable formats from pocket to population scale, that can analyse native DNA or RNA and sequence any length of fragment to achieve short to ultra-long read lengths.
 
Our goal is to enable the analysis of any living thing, by anyone, anywhere. We offer real-time nanopore-based DNA/RNA sequencing technology: accessible, easy to use and fully scalable for any requirement!
 
We are looking for a highly motivated individual to join the Informatics team as a Product Performance Analyst, whose primary role is to analyse and interpret the rich performance data produced internally and in-field by our instruments.
 
The Details...
 
This challenging role sits at the intersection of science and data. Oxford Nanopore platforms utilise a combination of biological, chemical, electronic and algorithm components to produce and read the electronic signal as DNA passes through a pore at nanoscale.
 
All components from sequencing chemistry kits to nanopores to electronics influence the characteristics of the data we generate. Rich information is captured about sequencing performance from most sequencing runs, both internally and from many customers. This large data set can be used to look prospectively at the influence of forthcoming suggested changes to all components as we test them in-house. It can also be used to rapidly identify emerging trends in performance in the field. Your role is to exploit that data and build the systems that allow that to be done effectively and efficiently.
 
You will identify variations in performance utilising data stored across a range of databases and logs. You will need to quickly establish a strong understanding of the science behind the product and subsequently continue to work closely with scientists across the company to understand how those variations are driven. Your work will allow our scientists to maintain confidence in the robustness of our products while we continue to innovate and iterate.
 
You will be comfortable building reusable pipelines where that supports effective analysis of the data and as part of that will be keen to adopt and promote good software engineering practices.
 
What We Are Looking For...
 
The ideal candidate will possess a genuine interest and expertise in Science, Analysis and Data Science. With an appropriate degree you will also have the following skills:
 
 
Proficient in Python
Proven ability to interpret data, understand underlying definition
Good data instincts (assess degree of confidence in findings, detect data quality issues, identify inconsistencies, filter out chaff)
Challenge assumptions
Possess excellent attention to detail
Able to apply scientific rigour


 
Experience in some of the following routinely used or similar technologies is expected:
 
 
MySQL
MongoDB
Git/Gitlab
Tableau/Spotfire


 
Applicants should be self-starting collaborators who enjoy taking on new challenges, are quickly adaptable in an exciting and fast-paced environment and are unafraid to speak out and investigate when things don’t add up.
 
We offer outstanding benefits to include an attractive bonus, generous pension contributions, private healthcare and an excellent starting salary. Based within beautiful, landscaped surroundings with tree-lined walks, water features and a lake, all of which make for a wonderful working environment.
 
If you are looking to utilise your skills to really make a difference to humankind, then consider joining our team and apply today!

Organization
 
Informatics is the study of how natural and artificial systems store, process and communicate information. Research in Informatics promises to take information technology to a new level, and to place information at the heart of 21st century science, technology and society. The School enjoys collaborations across many disciplines in the University, spanning all three College, and also participates as a strategic partner in the Alan Turing Institute and, with Heriot-Watt University, in the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics.
 
The School provides a fertile environment for a wide range of studies focused on understanding computation in both artificial and natural systems. It attracts students around the world to study in our undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, and currently has approximately 1000 undergraduate students, 320 MSc students and 350 PhD students. Informatics is one of seven schools in the College of Science and Engineering, at the University of Edinburgh. It is recognised for the employability of its graduates (demand exceeds supply), its contributions to entrepreneurship, and the excellence of its research. Since the first Research Assessment Exercise in 1986, Informatics at Edinburgh has consistently been assessed to have more internationally excellent and world-class research than any other submission in Computer Science and Informatics. The latest REF 2014 results have again confirmed that ours is the largest concentration of internationally excellent research in the UK. This contributes to our ranking in the top 15 CS departments world-wide according to the latest Times Higher Education ranking.
 
We aim to ensure that our culture and systems support flexible and family-friendly working and recognise and value diversity across all our staff and students. The School has an active programme offering support and professional development for all staff; providing mentoring, training, and networking opportunities.

It is a fast-growing firm centred around our innovative subscription model, offering clients certainty and efficiency in an industry steeped in tradition.


The firm undertakes a broad variety of IP work including:


· Availability searches and advice
· Strategic filing advice and global filing programmes

What does that mean? Great question.
 
We take
 
really complex data
 
as it relates to global security and empower our clients to not only understand the risk associated with their potential business relationships but to operationalize that data so that they can make the best and most informed decisions possible. From financial crimes and sanctions to export controls and threat identifications, our tools optimize protection against the types of security threats that could otherwise be incredibly dangerous and excessively costly to any business. Serving many of today’s leading global financial and multinational institutions, Kharon products are the most powerful in the space with a precision and depth that is absolutely unparalleled. Full stop.
 
 
When you look at any major global crisis event, we’re providing information that’s at the heart of those circumstances. We connect the dots in a way that’s meaningful. This year in particular, we’re experiencing unprecedented growth. The impact of recent global events, especially, has resulted in heightened demand for our products and services which is why we’re looking for our next Data Scientist, particularly in the GMT time zone or West Europe!
 
Data science is what propels our ability to
 
do what we do
. It fuels our decision making, drives our business outcomes, and enables us to improve our processes as we build scalable systems that power our products. Because of this, it’s time to expand our small but mighty Data Science team so that we can continue to support our incredible growth! Pivotal to our success, this is a role that will require you to analyze datasets, both structured and unstructured, to quantify risk exposure. Responsible for accessing and cleaning these datasets (of various formats, size, and complexity), you’ll extract key insights and deliver those in a way that empowers us to make the most informed and data-driven decisions possible.
 
 
Leaning on your computational, analytical, and statistical expertise, the insights you draw will support our product optimization, predictive analytics, and decision-making speed. Not only identifying the risks but creating and implementing the solutions, you’ll work cross-functionally to collect, possess, analyze, and interpret large amounts of data that inform our choices. It should be noted that your understanding of data visualization techniques should be
 
strong
. Working closely with our Technology, Engineering, and Data teams, you will implement data pipelines and machine learning solutions that solve complex problems, while writing well-designed, maintainable, and testable code.
 
 
While we are considering all applications, you will most likely find success if you have 1-3 years of experience under your belt and a strong understanding of statistics and machine learning methods ( including linear and nonlinear models, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian approaches). Experience working with the Python data stack, including data cleaning, analysis, and visualization will be required knowledge in your day-to-day work as well as an understanding of data querying languages such as SQL. If you have familiarity with or interest in global security threats and other issues impacting commerce and finance, that is only an added bonus!
 
 
The person filling this role must be located
 
in the GMT time zone or West Europe
, as you’ll be working closely with our team in those areas. Unfortunately, we will not consider applications outside of those regions at this time.
 
 
To better break down the position, here’s a bulleted list of what you could most closely expect your day-to-day responsibilities looking like:
 
 
Accessing and cleaning datasets in all shapes and sizes, including large-scale tabular data, knowledge graphs, and complex text corpora.
Producing and maintaining analyses, reports, and visualizations to discover and explain valuable insights.
Implementing data pipelines and Machine Learning solutions to solve complex problems while writing well-designed, maintainable, and testable code.
Collaborating with backend engineers for the development, deployment, scaling, and maintenance of the data systems and services you build.
Closely working with product and other subject matter experts to understand problems and design original solutions.


 
Consider yourself a leading candidate if you have experience with or an understanding of:
 
Natural Language Processing;
Graph Theory, Statistical Analysis of Networks, and Graph ML;
Graph Databases or Semantic Knowledge Graphs;
Big data technologies like Spark and Databricks;
Container-based deployment experience using Docker and Kubernetes;


 
So, that’s the role and to the right person, this will be the perfect kind of challenge. Our mission is compelling, our product is powerful and we’re growing at a rate that makes us unstoppable. If you’re looking to be surrounded by people who will inspire you to think and challenge you to grow then look no further! Our team is made up of some of the most visionary and uncompromising individuals you will ever meet. We don’t take ourselves seriously but we’re serious about the work we do and there is absolutely no slowing us down!
 
 
To keep that momentum going, we do our very best to make sure that each and every team member is completely taken care of. From generous time off and fully paid medical plans to daily catered lunches and full-loaded break rooms, we’re nothing without our people so we provide benefits and perks that reflect that.

Through our global online survey, we gather data on the behaviour and perceptions of consumers across the world. This provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust.
 
Diversity & Inclusion
 
Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We’d get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn’t have got off the ground as a business.

Although things certainly aren’t perfect, we live in a society where differences are increasingly celebrated – so we’d expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, it’s really important to us that it stays that way.

Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That's why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.
 
We're changing that. We're flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai's platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you're trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life - ANYONE's world-class ideas.
 
Building software needs to be like ordering pizza - pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.
 
Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.
 
Life at Builder.ai
At Builder.ai, we're looking for team players with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let's-get-stuff done attitude.

We're building intelligent security that works for human beings
 
as they are
, not how security policies would like them to be. Using machine learning technology, Tessian automatically predicts and eliminates advanced threats on email caused by human error - like data exfiltration, accidental data loss, business email compromise and phishing attacks - with minimal disruption to employees' workflow. As a result, employees are empowered to do their best work, without security getting in their way. You can read more about Human Layer Security here.
 
Tessian has raised a $74m Series C led by renowned security investors, March Capital (Crowdstrike, Knowbe4), with follow-on from Sequoia, Accel, Balderton, Latitude, Okta, Sozo, Citi & Schroder Adveq, to further our mission to secure the human layer.
 
Founded in 2013, Tessian is backed by world-class venture capital investors, has hubs in London, San Francisco, Boston, and Austin, and London, and is one of the Top-3 2021 Best Places to Work for Women.
 
As a high-growth scale-up, our email datasets are growing at an exponential rate. This is a great problem to have as it allows us to train best-in-class machine learning models to prevent previously unpreventable data breaches. We have scaled to the point where there are so many emails flowing through our system that need more human eyes to understand some more advanced patterns and feed them back into our algorithms.
 
You will sit in our Threat Intelligence team and work day-to-day with Threat Analysts, Data Scientists and Engineers to build out the flow of identifying any weak points in our algorithms and coming up with ways - in collaboration with our data scientists - to detect these types of emails. You will also work with Sales Engineers, identifying a better flow to surface the value of what Tessian does to our customers, which requires you to deeply understand the product and the way our customers benefit from it.
 
We view this role as a hugely impactful, high-leverage role and strongly believe that if we can have a smooth and robust feedback flow from incoming emails to outgoing ideas that we can deliver more value to our clients through the data breaches we prevent.
 
Some interesting projects we’re working on:
Building an advanced threat intelligence infrastructure
Training and Deploying advanced ML models on a combination of structured and unstructured (NLP) data.
Improving the deployment flow of algorithm changes to decrease time from idea to production
Automating reporting to surface product value to our customers
Designing the next generation data-lake setting ourselves up to handle massive future scale
 
Summary of day to day activities
Look at advanced email attacks and understand the underlying tactics used to try to bypass our systems
Label these emails to their correct categories to help the Algorithm teams to improve their ML Models
Take insights from these emails and leveraging our threat intelligence infrastructure to block similar threats in the future
Surfacing these ideas back to the Data Scientists so they can deploy more robust ways of blocking these tactics
Presenting to the wider company about threats we’re seeing to keep them informed
Taking calls with customers using our product to understand and surface the value of Tessian
Improving the tooling for reporting this value back to customers
 
Qualifications:
Have basic+ Python knowledge and the ability to look at datasets in Python
Ideally have experience with distributed data systems such as Spark
Have a real hunger for learning and pushing Threat Intelligence around Email Security to the next level
Ideally have experience in the email security field
Ideally have some experience with Machine Learning systems
Has an ability to break down ambiguous problems into concrete, manageable components and think through optimal solutions
Enjoys “getting their hands dirty” by digging into complex operations
Takes a high degree of ownership over their work
Is a clear communicator with professional presence
Has strong listening skills; open to input from other team members and departments
Has great attention to detail

We're looking for someone from a technical background with some experience in applying data analysis to real world problems, either within a commercial or academic setting. We'd like you to be curious, engaged and willing to learn, with the aim of helping clients make better, insight-driven decisions. You'll help answer questions such as 'where should we locate our next stores?' or 'how should we segment our audience to optimize marketing messaging?'.

Joining the Decision Science team will provide you with the training and opportunities to acquire a range of skills:

Visualisation and storytelling: data on its own does not drive value, so we place a high importance on how we communicate our findings, also making sure that our dashboards are user-friendly and get the point across. You'll be learning Tableau / Power BI / other visualisation tools, as well as how to structure and deliver an effective PowerPoint presentation.
 
Business acumen: because our focus is delivering data-driven strategies for the best possible customer experience, we constantly take the commercial implications of our analysis into account. This, combined with client exposure will allow you to gain a good understanding of the marketing industry and businesses in general.
 


We work closely with the Data Science and Experience Science teams which makes it possible to move in either direction if you want to be more or less exposed to data / clients.

This is an excellent opportunity for a bright, ambitious individual to be part of the strongest Marketing Sciences team in the country. There is a lot to do, a lot to learn, a lot to create, but it will put you at the forefront of our discipline.

Do you enjoy taking multiple systems, getting them to work together and taking those clunky data sets out of Excel into a great dashboard, visualisation in Power BI?
 
If so, this could be right up your street.
 
It’s an awesome opportunity for someone who wants to be the right hand person to the MD of this business. Your dashboards, insights and analytical reports will be the pulse of the business. Decisions will be made on them. You’ll truly help guide the business.
 
At present, they work using a combo of Netsuite and Excel.
 
They want to use Power BI, or similar. They’re not wedded to Power BI, they could be open to Tableau for example too. An awesome part of this job is, you’ll play a vital part in deciding that.
 
So, Power BI experience isn’t essential. If you’ve not used it but want to, they’ll train you on it. They’ll pay for a license for it. Same with Tableau or another alternative.
 
They do though, need someone with complex ERP experience. Preferably Net Suite, but, they realise that's a big ask, so, they'll absolutely consider other systems. They want to someone eager to be a part of the Netsuite project though. The implementation of that system is still going through, and it’s not quite perfect yet. So, they need someone who can dive into Netsuite, link it with their sales systems and then produce the visuals with the right software. It’s a role you can truly make your own, and a role you can really make a name for yourself in.
 
It will be office based 95% of the time. They’re a close knit team. The leadership team who you’ll work extremely closely with, are in every day working together and collaborating so it’s going to be hugely beneficial to be in the office. That being said, on those days you just need to get your head down every once in a while, of course work from home. Same goes if the boiler breaks, or kids are off school etc. They’re not a long hours culture and they will be as flexible as they can for the right person. So, things like nursery drop off, school drops etc won’t be a problem if you need to do those things.
 
 
 
Production of insightful dashboards and analysis for the board / leadership team in the business
Development of existing KPI and MI reporting suites
Development of Netsuite system to ensure the sales information is reported correctly and the correct reports are produced
Management of internal stakeholder requests and queries

Of course, as a Data Engineer, you might not give a hoot about that. For you it might just be about the tech, well then this lovely team also tick that box as well.
 
With serious data know-how, using emerging technologies, AI and machine learning, these guys are the envy of others in their space but they’re also really down-to-earth and up for a few laughs along the way!
 
The sector they operate in is largely irrelevant, all you need to know is that it's a world-class tech business that is building an exciting data strategy that your career and skills will benefit from and that the competition will be envious of!
 
 
So what will you do - here comes the normal boring job spec bit!
 
 
 
You’ll design, build and deploy data products and pipelines and architectural vision and roadmaps - obviously
You’ll be right in the centre of a talented team of engineers that listens to each other's ideas!
Sure you’ll work to exacting quality standards but this is because you want to set an industry benchmark, that will disrupt the status quo and be part of something really distinctive
 
Of course, you’ll have alignment with the business stakeholders but because you’ll want to blow them away with your technical vision and put their ideas into production!


 
Here is a long list of technical skills we hope you’ll come with, but you may also see this as a list of skills your gain or strengthen in this role!
 
 
 
Highly proficient in building and maintaining data pipelines in Databricks
Highly proficient in data engineering technologies, such as Delta Lake, Apache Spark, Azure Data Factory etc.
Highly proficient in big data engineering programming languages such as Python and/or Scala
Experience with cloud technologies, especially GCP and Azure
Experience in T-SQL and maintenance of SSIS packages
Highly proficient in ETL Process Development
Experience of Data Modelling
Experience of Data Warehousing dimensional modelling techniques.
Some experience in .NET C# or Terraform would be useful
Experience in the usage of a continuous delivery system and related concepts
Experience in the usage of data reporting tools, such as PowerBI
Strong understanding of application security concepts, including securing production applications and delivery pipelines
Strong understanding of systems required in delivering commercial finance products, and how they fit together (i.e. loan origination systems, loan management systems, collections systems)
Strong understanding of data governance concepts such as data ownership, data stewardship etc


 
And as for a list of non-technical skills, we’re just looking for committed and collabotative people that have a positive attitude and little or no ego!
 
 
Here’s the thing, if you’re looking to work in a great company that cares about you, if you want to work with a team of people you can respect and can learn from, and if you’re looking for the right mix of home/office work this could be the perfect role.
 
 
The tech speaks for itself and we know you won’t work here for millennia, so if you want to hang out with some cool people, develop some great data-driven products and learn skills that will increase your market worth in the future, this is the right place.
 
 
And if you find the directness and candour in this post unappealing then this is probably not the right place for you either!! Fancy a grown-up, frank and friendly conversation - reach out to me Simon Bucknell! There is a bunch of stuff I need to explain about this company and this role!!

Society’s data superpowers are gathering dust due to a problem that is easy to describe but hard to solve: The data required to solve the world's most pressing problems isn't the kind that's easily shared.
The limitations of current data infrastructure have created painful, slow, expensive and often ineffective workarounds for what should be seamless collaborations between trusted partners. But it doesn't have to be this way. ‍So we're building a missing piece of global infrastructure: a secure network to enable organisations to send algorithms to data. This means they can share the benefits of their data with each other, without having to go through the painful and risky process of moving it around, without compromising its privacy, and without even needing to expose any raw data.
 
Right now, we’re heads-down on applying our platform to the problem of clinical trial recruitment in the Healthcare space. We’re enabling privacy-preserving collaboration between healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies, which will remove a major friction point in the process, and help ensure critical medicines make it through trials and into the hands of those who need them much sooner.
 
We believe that great software is built by great people working in great teams, and we’re working hard to make Bitfount a home for both. We’re committed to building an organisation that people are proud to be part of, where everyone can learn and grow, where everyone is supported, and where everyone can do the best, most meaningful work of their careers in a cross-disciplinary environment. Everyone’s viewpoint is valued and we work hard to foster a culture of open discussion. We’re backed by top UK and international investors and a stellar advisory team.

You should be comfortable with high quality software practices (including code-reviews, testing practices, and software design), happy to work in a diverse team, be willing to participate in our team-led discussions, and generally be interested in making sure artificial intelligence and data are used to make the world a better place.

Developing a flexible yet robust backend that allows users to build machine learning models and perform data analytics whilst preserving privacy

Analytical Research and Development (ARD)
 
Department Overview
 
Analytical Research and Development (ARD) is accountable for providing a wide range of analytical testing to support the development, testing and release of materials to be used in clinical trials. The department comprises laboratory scientists, ably supported by data analytics specialists who use their understanding of key enterprise applications to help manage and automate data “flow” around the department efficiently. We manage and interpret the data we generate, to convert it into knowledge that establishes the quality of new medicines.

We encourage applications from students thinking about pursuing careers in data science, both with and without a specific chemistry focus.
 
What can I achieve and what will I be accountable for whilst completing a placement at Pfizer?
 
A placement year in ARD provides excellent industrial experience and practical use of contemporary laboratory information systems, and semantic tools to better comprehend data. Our data scientists have a strong interest in pushing the boundaries of how we use our systems, and are good at translating user needs into data management solutions. During the year, there will also be opportunities to work on established and emerging data modelling/machine learning applications, if that is an area of interest to the student.

You will be assigned one or more projects based on needs at the time of joining our fast-moving department, and will develop both strong team working and technical skills. It is expected that you will provide creative input and direction into your work, and present your progress and achievements to both technical and non-technical audiences throughout your placement.

Pfizer offers a diverse environment which allows employees numerous opportunities to grow and develop. This is a great chance to be part of the bigger picture, and to assist in ensuring Pfizer maintains a strong and diverse workforce as well as developing a talent pipeline of future Pfizer colleagues. It is also a fantastic way to obtain a better appreciation of the pharma industry and the type of roles it has to offer.
 
What other opportunities and benefits do Pfizer offer?
 
In this data science role, you will network with colleagues locally and globally, as our enterprise systems have users in both UK and USA. In addition to developing your communication and project delivery skills, many students find the time to support Pfizer’s outreach activities, at Science Fairs, and through our STEM networks. We also support colleagues who wish to develop their presentation skills to a high level through giving scientific lectures to a department with groups in both the UK and US.

You will receive a competitive salary along with benefits including 25.5 days annual leave.

This involves focusing on learning, development and progression across the business. Training our leaders, managers and teams about their rights under our equality, diversity and inclusion policy. And being clear on the responsibilities we hold to each other and our community. It also means being committed to equal employment opportunities. Ensuring we consider ALL applicants for jobs. And work harder to make our job advertising more inclusive.
Ultimately, we’re working to create a culture and team that represents our customers, our community and our mission of empowerment. We want to celebrate our diversity and the power it gives our team and our business.
We know we’re on a journey. And far from perfect. But we want to be a part of the solution to the problem. It might not be comfortable or straightforward. But if we weren’t up for doing the hard work and breaking the mould, we wouldn’t be Sweaty Betty. We are committed to working across our business and with our Internal Diversity & Inclusion Collective to be champions, allies and inclusive, always.

Sika is a specialty chemicals company with a leading position in the development and production of systems and products for waterproofing, bonding, sealing, damping, reinforcing, and protecting in the building sector and motor vehicle industry. Sika has subsidiaries in 101 countries around the world and manufactures in over 300 factories. Its more than 27,000 employees generated annual sales of CHF 9.3 billion in 2021.
 
The role centres around the investigation of cutting-edge data science techniques to drive operational efficiency and sustainability initiatives in the manufacture of cementitious products. As part of the R&D network, you will be instrumental in ensuring Sika's trajectory towards becoming the standout low-emissions, high-efficiency supplier of cement-based systems.
 
The R&D/Data Science student internship has been running for a number of years and has become a critical component of our operations. Students split their time between leveraging data science techniques in order to improve our understanding of industrial raw materials and streamline our portfolio and processes, and working in the laboratory to test their predictions, improving old products, and even designing new ones.
 
The Opportunity-
 
 
Actively pursue an understanding of data science techniques and how they can be utilised in chemical and industrial processes
Spend time working in a research environment, developing a strong knowledge of how different ingredients affect the properties of final products, and the interplay between them
Ideate with a focus on how we can aid in the solution of complex problems using data science, machine learning or AI
Design testing protocols and scrupulously adhere to them, ensuring that your data collection is consistent and complete
 


The Rewards-
 
You will be rewarded with a competitive salary, and a sweep of great benefits. We pride ourselves on our total reward package-
 
 
Holiday 25 days rising to 28 days with service, plus bank holidays
Hybrid Working
 
Core Hours Working between 10.00-16.00
A company pension contribution of up to 10%
Private healthcare for you, with option to add family
 
Group life cover at 6x your annual salary
 
Global Income Protection (PHI)
 
Enhanced maternity and paternity pay
Staff discount platform & Cycle to Work scheme
 
Dedicated Service Awards for reaching key milestones
Selected discounted Sika products
 


The Support-
 
You will join the data science unit of Sika UK, which is nestled inside the greater R&D team. Your primary mentorship and supervisor will come from the members of the Data Science unit, but the R&D team will be constantly present, teaching you laboratory techniques and ensuring the social aspect of your hybrid working experience is not lost. The manager of R&D will be your senior line manager. Sika R&D operates under a no doors policy, meaning we are always available to talk.
 
Joining the R&D / DS team will give you an insight into the different worlds of industrial research, operational logistics and data science. You will come away with a multitude of new skills, in areas including data manipulation; the fundamentals of machine learning; knowledge of cementitious chemistry; understanding of standards and safe manufacturing processes, not to mention significant experience in laboratory and digital work. Each intern has been a success story, boasting achievements from designing new product lines to finding new raw materials that could revolutionise national industry. A significant commitment to professional and personal development from day one.
 
The Future-
 
The possession of deep knowledge in the topics of machine learning and data science is an invaluable skill in today's employment landscape. Moreover, despite their prevalence in logistics and manufacturing, such advanced techniques have yet to see sufficient permeation into industrial R&D, especially in the world of construction materials. The pairing of experience in both of these worlds sets you up excellently for a bright future.
 
We welcome expressions of interest from all eligible applicants. The Construction Industry and the Sika salesforce remain disproportionately under-represented by women and we therefore particularly welcome applications from women interested in a sales career in the building supplies and materials industry. Accordingly, we aim to provide an enabling and inclusive working environment for all.
 
We Need Your Skills
 
 
You must be pursuing an undergraduate degree in a field strongly linked to chemistry or process engineering
A strong willingness to learn about completely new, and perhaps unintuitive subjects
Mathematical fluency - a minimum of A-Level is preferred
Excellence in the presentation of complex topics and data to non-expert audiences
No prior coding skills are required, but they are appreciated
Good knowledge of standard laboratory practices, safety and etiquette

About us:
 
BeZero Carbon is a global ratings agency for the Voluntary Carbon Market. Our ratings allow all market participants to price and manage risk. BeZero’s ratings and research tools support buyers, intermediaries, investors, and carbon project developers.
 
Founded in April 2020, our 120+-strong team combines climatic and earth sciences, sell-side financial research, earth observation, machine learning, data and technology, engineering, and public policy expertise. We work from five continents.
 
www.bezerocarbon.com
 
Background on the role:
 
BeZero is looking for a mid- or senior-level data engineer to join our data engineering & data science team. The team currently consists of 7 experienced data engineers and scientists, who are building data and machine learning products for our client-facing platform and internal teams. The team sits at the heart of the business, working across our ratings, product and technology teams.
 
As a data team, we have a bias towards shipping products, staying close to our internal and external customers, and owning our infrastructure and deployments end-to-end. This is a team that follows software engineering best practices closely: no production code found in Jupyter notebooks here! Our data stack looks as follows
 
 
 
AWS as our cloud infrastructure provider.
 
Snowflake as our central data warehouse for tabular data. AWS S3 is used for any non-tabular data (e.g., satellite imagery data). We also use PostGIS for querying geospatial vector data.
 
dbt for building SQL-style data models and taking care of the ‘T’ in ELT.
 
Python jobs for non-SQL data transformations, using packages like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and many more.
 
Prefect as our workflow orchestration manager, with our jobs executed on AWS ECS.
 
Metabase as a dashboarding solution for end-users.
 
GitHub Actions for CI / CD.


 
You’ll be responsible for building productionised data pipelines that handle a variety of data types: we process a lot of tabular data but increasingly process large geospatial data sets (think different types of satellite imagery) as well. You’ll play a key role in building out further our data infrastructure, and there will also be opportunities to contribute to building our machine learning operations infrastructure.
 
You’re welcome to work in our London-based office, but we very much welcome applications remotely if you can work GMT +/- 3 hours. You’d be reporting into our Chief Data Strategist Thomas, who joined recently from data and machine learning consultancy QuantumBlack and McKinsey & Co, and represents the data organisation at the executive level.
 
Responsibilities:
 
You will be an individual contributor on our central data team, focused on developing and maintaining our cloud-based (AWS) data infrastructure used to build data products to be deployed on our carbon markets platform.
 
You will build automated pipelines that collect, manipulate and extract structured and unstructured information about voluntary carbon market projects.
 
You will be charged with finding ways to monitor and maintain data flows, enable self-service analysis to business users, and to create and improve scalable data pipelines.
 
You will develop a suite of production data models using dbt to transform our internal data into a form suitable for analytics and reporting work.
 
You’ll be our ideal candidate if:
 
You care deeply about the climate and carbon markets and are excited by solutions for decarbonising our economy.
 
You have 3+ years of experience for the mid-level role, or 5+ years of experience for the senior level role, in building ELT pipelines in production for data engineering and machine learning use cases.
 
You have hands-on experience with workflow orchestration tools (e.g., Prefect, Dagster, Airflow, Luigi), containerization, a cloud platform (we use AWS but any cloud platform will do) and the Python scientific computing stack (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, pandas, etc).
 
You have experience working with a modern data warehouse such as Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift, and know how to write production-grade SQL.
 
You can write clean, maintainable, scalable, and robust code in Python and SQL, and are familiar with collaborative coding best practices (e.g., for Python PEP8 code style, unit testing, continuous integration tools such as flake8, black, isort, etc). You are a highly collaborative individual who wants to solve problems that drive business value.
 
Bonus points (but we’d still like to hear from you if you don’t have experience in any of these)
 
You have experience in deploying cloud resources using tools such as AWS Cloud Formation, Terraform, etc.
 
You have experience working with raster and vector geospatial data sets, and are familiar with the packages for processing such data (e.g., rasterio, geopandas, xarray, gdal)
 
You have practical knowledge of software engineering concepts and best practices, inc. DevOps, DataOps, and MLOps.
 
You have experience in building and deploying deep learning models for computer vision use-cases.
 
Research has shown that women are less likely than men to apply for a role if they don’t have experience in 100% of the requirements outlined in a job description. Please know that even if you don’t have experience in all the areas above but think you could do a great job and are excited about shaping company culture, finding great people, and building great teams, we’d love to hear from you!
 
What we’ll offer:
 
 
Competitive salary and opportunity for equity in a rapidly growing VC-backed start-up through share options
Ability to learn and develop alongside a range of sector specialists from the scientific, economic and business community
Opportunity to work in a cross-cutting role, interacting with lots of different parts of the business
Growth opportunities that come from working at a fast-paced VC-backed technology business
Opportunity to work remote or in our Central London office space (Old Street) with flexibility to work from home + some flexibility over working location during the summer
Regular social events
25 days leave (with additional time off between Christmas and New Year, and for your birthday)
Private medical insurance, dental, critical illness cover, income protection, life assurance, medical cash plan, cycle to work scheme, and a health and wellness cash allowance


 
We value diversity at BeZero Carbon. We need a team that brings different perspectives and backgrounds together to build the tools needed to make the voluntary carbon market transparent.

At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.

Data Storage is a critical component of our platform functionality, which encompasses traditional relational databases (primarily PostgreSQL), Key-Value stores like Redis and (our very own) Quicksilver, and distributed filesystem technologies. As we grow and scale, our portfolio of data storage options will need to grow with us.
 
Responsibilities
 
We’re looking to establish a team of engineers who will be dedicated to databases and storage at Cloudflare. This team will encompass the full lifecycle of provisioning, monitoring, tuning, and scaling storage solutions. This team will work closely with both SRE and Engineering to provide a highly-automated, highly available and extremely resilient data platform that scales with us.

Direct experience shipping, supporting, and managing distributed systems with demanding consumers.
 
 
Expertise in operating/administering a traditional relational database system, preferably PostgreSQL

Desirable Skills
 
 
 
Experience designing multi-tenant database solutions, capacity planning, designing for failover, fault-tolerance, and disaster recovery.
 
 
Experience managing distributed storage systems such as Ceph and HDFS.
 
 
Experience developing software in Go, Python or C/C++
 
 
Formal computer science background (BS/MS in Computer Science or equivalent)
 
 
Experience with alerting and monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and Kibana
 
 
Experience with configuration management software, preferably Salt.
 


 
Bonus Points
 
 
 
Interest in newer database technologies like CockroachDB
 
 
Experience with stream processing technologies
 
 
Experience with non-relational data stores such as time-series databases (ex. OpenTSDB), key-value stores (ex. Redis), columnar databases (ex. ClickHouse), and full text search engines (ex. ElasticSearch)
 
 
Experience with data warehousing tools and patterns

Athenian Project

1.1.1.1

Recruitment Fraud
 
Cyber criminals advertise fake job adverts with prestigious employers as a way of stealing information or even defrauding individuals out of money. In the most sophisticated cases, they will set up fake websites, which have a similar address to companies like Unilever. They even conduct fake telephone interviews and then offer candidates a role with the proviso they pay a fee for background checks or to cover work visa costs.  These types of attacks are becoming more common as more people are looking for employment in the economic climate.
 
How is Unilever tackling this?
 
Many of Unilever’s recruitment sites publish a warning to candidates about recruitment fraud. The Cyber Security team also proactively scan for signs of people setting up fake Unilever sites and act to close them down.
 
What can I do?
 
If you become aware of potential recruitment fraud, spot fake Unilever recruitment adverts or fake LinkedIn profiles, report them via Una Live Chat.

Our vision is to create a safe and sustainable world
Ricardo plc is a global strategic, environmental, and engineering consulting company, listed on the London Stock Exchange. With over
100 years of engineering excellence and employing close to 3,000 employees in more than 20 countries, we provide exceptional levels of expertise in delivering leading-edge and innovative cross-sector sustainable products and solutions. Every day, we enable our customers to solve the most complex and dynamic challenges to help achieve a safe and sustainable world.
 
Energy & Environment, one of Ricardo plc's five operating business units, is a leader in sustainability consultancy, solving complex environmental challenges through industry-leading analysis, advice and data. With more than 40 years of heritage in addressing air quality, environmental and sustainability issues, our customers value us for our deep understanding and breadth of services covering the entire value chain from evidence, policy & strategy to implementation.
 
We are currently looking for a Customer Data Consultant to join our NCEC Emergency Response team.
 
The National Chemical Emergency Centre (NCEC) sits within the Chemical Risk practice of Ricardo Energy and Environment and has a 40+ year reputation as a premium provider of global chemical emergency response provision. NCEC works with a global client base including 50% of the world's top 100 chemical manufacturers and a large number of other public and private sector clients.
 
As part of NCEC's emergency response helpline, chemical companies display the NCEC emergency telephone number on their chemical product paperwork (typically, safety data sheets ""SDS""). These documents are registered on a bespoke emergency response database, along with instructions (""procedures"") which tell our emergency call handlers how to respond to an emergency call on that company's behalf. The role of the Customer Data Consultant is to ensure that customer information is processed accurately and in a timely manner, making both SDS and procedures available for the emergency call handlers when taking calls - a critically important part of the process. The Customer Data Consultant will liaise with the delivery team and customers to facilitate this process - a great opportunity to develop customer facing skills.
 
NCEC's business continues to grow and as we expand our customer base the amount of information that we need to manage also increases. For example, we currently store around 1.7 million customer SDS and customers regularly send through new data when they add products to their ranges. The role is essential to the provision of NCEC's product offering as the work links directly into the delivery of the Emergency Response service.
 
Purpose
 
If you're great with data, great with customers, are looking to grow and develop a role and have a desire to work for an organisation that makes a difference in the world, then this role is for you!
 
The successful applicant will join the emergency response delivery team and will be responsible for providing a service to our clients using bespoke databases to process customer data and create procedures.
 
The main role of the Customer Data Consultant is to liaise with the delivery team and the customer with the focus on ensuring that customer data is input accurately and efficiently and that procedures are created when a new customer joins and that they are actively maintained during the life of the contract. The applicant would also be expected to take an active role in interactions with the customer where the data or procedures are more complex and do not fit within our standard 'template'. Any issues should be promptly identified and resolved in order to meet the customer's expectations.
 
From the data perspective, this includes taking responsibility for the processing, registration, manipulation, storage and associated linking of this data. For example, documents need to be correctly registered against a customer and any impact on their procedures would need to be highlighted. It is essential that customer data is structured so that it is quick and easy for our responders to access in order to provide accurate telephone advice.
 
For the procedures, their key purpose is to provide guidance to the Emergency Responder when they are handling a call. The element of the role is very reactive as new customers are joining all the time and are often requesting changes at short notice when their business demands it.
 
There is also a proactive element to the role which is to develop and deliver a continual improvement process for both the areas (SDS and procedures) to ensure that all customer data is reviewed on a regular basis. The Customer Data Consultant will also conduct data analysis tasks where the aim will be to create visual representations of trends and draw actionable conclusions.
 
The successful applicant will join a small team who are delivering a number of different customer facing roles. The role is aimed at an individual who can work efficiently with minimal supervision but can also work closely with the Data and Procedures Consultant already in post as well as with other members of the team to draw on their particular specialisms as required. The successful applicant will be working closely with the Head of the Customer Service to enable them to develop their own customer relationships.
 
Key competencies and skills:
 
Essential:
 
Undergraduate degree or A-levels in a numerate subject(s)
A proven track record of working in a process driven environment, with data entry experience focusing on the speed and accuracy of task completion
Advanced IT skills (understanding of and practical application) in order to act as the 'bridge' between our internal IT teams and customers
Effective problem-solving skills with ability to take responsibility for an issue and show initiative in finding resolution
High level of accuracy and attention to detail
Organisational skills in relation to task management and time management
Able to work under pressure and manage multiple data sets whilst meeting customer deadlines through effective prioritisation
Effective verbal and written communication skills
Proficient in the use of standard office software packages, with a good working knowledge of Excel


 
Desirable:
 
Experience of providing excellent customer service
Knowledge and / or understanding of Safety Data Sheets
A strong logical approach but the ability to think laterally
Advanced research skills to be able to review and understand how a company is structured and how their operations fit within that structure
Familiarity of, or interest in, chemistry / chemical industry

What you can expect. Our key values underpin everything we do:
 
Never stop talking to kids, and adults, on a human level
 
 
We take time to see things from a kid’s perspective; we invest time to listen to them, hear them and validate their experiences and opinions. By doing this we’re able to help an industry that often feels they know better about what kids want than the kids themselves. And it’s the same with how we work with clients.


 
Loyalty matters
 
 
Whether it be colleagues or clients, this is something we value hugely. Working at or with KidsKnowBest is always a two-way street, a partnership not an arrangement. We have huge ambitions here, but no matter how big we get it is important to always remember how you got here.


 
Always disrupt
 
 
“But we’ve always done it like that.” In a fast-moving and ever-changing landscape, this way of thinking doesn’t align with our values. Our natural state is to be disruptive and this needs to be harnessed for good. Ask questions and challenge the status quo; Does it have to be like this? Is there a better solution? Don’t disrupt for the sake of it. Disruptive thinking shouldn’t be a distraction from knowing a good thing when we see it, but it should empower an open-minded approach to a problem.


 
Think differently
 
 
Never assume, always think differently. However you do it, always find the insight and data to back it up. You might think you’ve got an amazing idea, and you probably have. Now find the data to back it up or conduct an experiment and make others believe.


 
Approach with agnosticism
 
 
“We all fear what we do not understand.” Unless there is data to support, almost everything in life is subjective. Our interests and thoughts may be vastly different to the kids we interact with but that doesn’t mean either is right or wrong. For every sound argument against, there will also be a sound argument for. We want to listen and understand kids and their interests. We can’t do that authentically if we come in with our own prejudices. We need to instead assess things fairly with an open mind and no preconceptions.


 
Be nice

An opportunity has arisen for a talented statistician or probabilistic machine learning methods developer to join Dr Paul Kirk's group at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge University, as part of the MIMAH (Minimising Mortality from Alcoholic Hepatitis) Consortium; see also: https://www.mimah.org
 
Alcohol related liver disease (ALD) is responsible for more than 6000 deaths a year in the UK and costs the NHS £3.5 billion. Alcoholic hepatitis is a florid presentation of ALD in which patients present with jaundice and liver failure. Unfortunately, around 30% of people admitted to hospital with this condition will die within 3 months. The treatment of alcoholic hepatitis is complicated by the fact that there is inflammation within the liver whilst the patient is very susceptible to infection. As a result, treatment with drugs, such as steroids, which suppress the immune system may exacerbate the risk of infection.
 
We will apply state of the art Bayesian clustering and machine learning approaches to analyse data collected within the MIMAH consortium and as part of the STOPAH trial; see also https://www.mimah.org/biostatistics
 
We are seeking an ambitious and motivated individual to contribute to this research. The team has strong collaborations with groups across the Cambridge Biomedical Campus and beyond. Current team members are working on unsupervised, semi-supervised and outcome-guided clustering and integrative clustering, multi-view modelling, multiple kernel learning, Bayesian nonparametrics, and matrix factorisation approaches, across an array of applications.
 
The successful candidate will have a PhD in a strongly quantitative discipline, ideally statistics or probabilistic machine learning. Experience with biomedical applications would be highly advantageous, but not essential. A desire to address questions of substantive biological importance and disease relevance is essential. Good communication skills and an enthusiasm for collaborating with others are also essential. Strong programming ability would be desirable, and experience of Bayesian clustering and variable selection approaches would be advantageous. Experience with clinical and molecular datasets would be highly desirable. The successful applicant will be supported in their career development with a range of formal courses and on-the-job training.
 
The Unit is situated on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, one of the world's most vibrant centres of biomedical research, which includes the University of Cambridge's Clinical School, two major hospitals, the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, and the world headquarters of Astra Zeneca.
 
The Unit is actively seeking to increase diversity among its staff, including promoting an equitable representation of men and women. The Unit therefore especially encourages applications from women, from minority ethnic groups and from those with non-standard career paths. Appointment will be made on merit.
