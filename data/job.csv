Market forces are dramatically reshaping supply chains, forcing drastic changes in trading behaviors between manufacturers, distributors and retailers. Many key business decisions are being made without a single source of truth to back them up, resulting in struggles to keep up with consumer expectations and increased disputes between partners.
 
At Enable, we believe in removing barriers between trading partners to create a healthier supply chain — and there’s no better way to do this than with rebates. Rebates drive partner behaviors, while increasing loyalty and trust. They help businesses and their trading partners better understand their data, boost their financial performance, mitigate risks, and drive efficiency and trust. When trading partners can make the best decisions for their businesses, everyone wins: manufacturers, distributors, retailers and, most importantly, end consumers.

The key challenge of this role is to develop data visualisations and user interfaces to improve our effectiveness in car development and our performance on track.
 
 
 
 
Role Dimensions:
 
 
 
 
This role lies within the Data Science team, which is part of the Software & Data Science department.  This team is responsible for a range of bespoke software applications and data tools used to process and analyse data, as well as improve the accuracy and efficiency of experimentation. This is achieved through development of analysis capabilities realised by advanced modelling and visualisation, as well as business analysis of the end-to-end workflows across the whole of the Racing team.
 
 
Data is the lifeblood of a Formula 1 team, flowing from the race car, test environments, and simulation. Understanding this data – extracting every drop of learning from it – is essential for car development and racing.
 
 
 
As a Data Visualisation Engineer, you will build on a foundation of knowledge in software development, data analysis, and visualisation techniques to develop innovative, data-driven solutions to technical challenges alongside senior members of the team. This will involve developing and supporting our internal analysis software platforms, to aid our learning from measured and simulated data. You will focus on producing innovative and performant solutions to visualising complex data in novel ways; creating intuitive, interactive user interfaces that unlock understanding and aid rapid, data-driven decision making.
 
 
 
You will work on projects through all stages of the development life cycle from initial analysis and requirements gathering through to deployment and operational support. Your work will be a mixture of longer-term development projects and operational support of the wind tunnel, simulator, and race car.
 
 
You will work in close cooperation and co-development with the other members of the team, as well as stakeholders across Engineering, in particular Aero Development, CFD and R&D. Hence, you should be comfortable both working on a project by yourself and jointly with others.
 
 
 
 
You need a keen desire to learn software development, particularly visualisation tools, following the department’s guiding principles, and a passion to use your skills to make the car faster.  Racing forges close teams. As such, we invest in our people, providing mentoring and professional development opportunities, particularly for those near the start of their careers.
 
 
 
Occasional flexibility to work out of office hours and weekends may be required. The role will be primarily based at the prestigious McLaren Technology Centre with a proportion of the time spent working from home.
